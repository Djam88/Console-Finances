# Financial Records Analysis

This JavaScript code analyzes a dataset of profit/loss records to calculate various financial metrics. It performs the following calculations:

- Total number of months included in the dataset
- Net total amount of profit/losses over the entire period
- Average change in profit/losses over the entire period
- Greatest increase in profit/losses (date and amount) over the entire period
- Greatest decrease in profit/losses (date and amount) over the entire period

## Dataset

The dataset used for analysis is an array of monthly financial records for a period between Jan 2010-Feb 2017. Each record consists of two fields: `Date` and `ProfitLoss`.
