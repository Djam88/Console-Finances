# Financial Records Analysis

This JavaScript code analyzes a dataset of profit/loss records to calculate various financial metrics. It performs the following calculations:

- Total number of months included in the dataset
- Net total amount of profit/losses over the entire period
- Average change in profit/losses over the entire period
- Greatest increase in profit/losses (date and amount) over the entire period
- Greatest decrease in profit/losses (date and amount) over the entire period

## Dataset

The dataset used for analysis is an array of objects, with each object representing a record. Each record has two fields: `Date` and `ProfitLoss`.

## Usage

1. Modify the `dataset` array in the code to contain the actual profit/loss records you want to analyze.

2. Open the HTML file that includes this JavaScript code in a web browser.

3. Open the browser's developer console.

4. The output of the analysis will be printed in the console.
